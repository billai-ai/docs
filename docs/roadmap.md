# Roadmap

We do not currently publish a public roadmap or commit to specific features or timelines.

---

## Why No Public Roadmap?

We prefer to ship features when they're ready rather than promise things we might not deliver. This keeps expectations honest and allows us to respond to what developers actually need.

---

## What's Available Now

For current capabilities, see:

- [How It Works](/docs/how-it-works.md) — Core platform functionality
- [Quickstart](/docs/quickstart.md) — Get started with BillAI

## Request a Feature

We read every request and prioritize based on developer needs.
