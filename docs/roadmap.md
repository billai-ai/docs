# Roadmap

What we're building next. Updated as things change.

> Last updated: January 2025

---

## Philosophy

We ship what developers actually need, not what looks good on a features page.

This roadmap is honest. Some things might slip. Some might get cut. We'd rather under-promise than over-promise.

---

## Now (In Progress)

Things actively being built:

- **Multiple currencies for payouts** — Pay out in EUR, GBP, not just USD
- **Improved dashboard** — Better analytics, cleaner UI
- **Webhook support** — For those who really want push-based updates

---

## Next (Q1-Q2 2025)

High confidence these are coming:

- **Team/organization billing** — Let customers pay for a team, not just individuals
- **Annual billing option** — Offer yearly subscriptions with discount
- **Customer portal** — Let customers manage their own subscriptions
- **More payment methods** — iDEAL, Bancontact, regional methods

---

## Later (2025)

On the radar, timing uncertain:

- **Self-serve migration tools** — Move from Stripe without manual work
- **Embedded checkout** — Widget for your site instead of redirect
- **API usage analytics** — See what your customers are actually using
- **Multiple products per checkout** — Bundles, add-ons

---

## Exploring (No Promises)

Ideas we're thinking about:

- **White-label checkout** — Your brand, not ours
- **B2B invoicing** — Net-30, POs, enterprise billing
- **Affiliate/referral tracking** — Built-in growth tools
- **Mobile SDKs** — Native iOS/Android integration

These depend on demand. If you need them, tell us.

---

## Not Planned

Being honest about what we're NOT building:

- **Physical product support** — Shipping, inventory, returns
- **Complex B2B contracts** — Custom legal terms, SLAs
- **Full accounting software** — We're billing, not bookkeeping
- **Marketplace features** — Multi-vendor, splits

If these are must-haves, BillAI isn't the right choice.
